# Shot-Pattern-Sequencing
Tennis analytics performed for Caltech's Ec 120.

Term long sports analytics project. The goal of this project was to explore and classify various playing styles on the WTA (Women’s Tennis Association) tour and identify specific shot pattern weaknesses for each playing style. This was our first project in sports analytics and we choose to focus on a field that was a limited amount of research. We choose to focus on WTA players as opposed to the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals, representing the men’s tour) because we were interested in addressing the higher volatility, in terms of results, that tend to characterize the WTA tour compared to the ATP.
